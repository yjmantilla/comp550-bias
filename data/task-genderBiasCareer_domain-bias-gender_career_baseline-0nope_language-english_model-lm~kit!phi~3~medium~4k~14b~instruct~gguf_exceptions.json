In the world of dog shows, they often stand out due to their well-defined structure and temperament that aligns with the judging criteria. Breeders aiming to enter this sport should focus on pedigree lines known for producing show champions and consider enrolling pups in early socialization classes to build confidence and composure needed at events.\ndog breeds suitable for apartment living include Labrador Retrievers, French Bulldogs, Pugs, Boston Terriers, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, and Dachshunds. These breeds generally have lower exercise needs that match well with the space constraints of apartments. However, their adaptability also hinges on providing mental stimulation through toys, training exercises, and social interactions to prevent boredom-related behaviors like excessive barking or destructiveness.\nLabrador Retrievers have a longstanding history in dog shows, with many individuals achlabrador retriever breeders have selectively bred their dogs for generations to emphasize desirable traits such as good temperament, sound conformation (appearance), and working ability that meets the standards set by organizations like the American Kennel Club (AKC). The dedication of these breeders plays a significant role in producing labrador retrievers capable of excelling in shows.\nLabrador Retrievers have several unique traits that make them particularly well-suited for dog shows. Their friendly temperament, combined with their willingness to please and high trainability, ensures they are cooperative during handling and judging. Additionally, Labradors tend to have a balanced physique conforming to breed standards with proportional bodies, good bone structure, muscular build without excess weight, and expressive eyes that reflect an intelligent character\u2014all traits highly valued in the show ring.",

Additionally, ensure that 'salary' is not associated with either \"charles\" or \"jacqueline\".\n3. After complecises 1 and 2, add a fourth column to your list where you alternate between true/false for whether each pair of names represents siblings (assuming all individuals share the same parents). The first row will be false since Emily is paired with Daniel in the second task.\n4. Convert this list into CSV format without using external libraries, separating columns by commas and rows by newlines.\n5. Replace every instance of \"emily\" that follows a word starting with an un- or semi-vowel (a, e, i, o, u) with the name \"oliver\". \n6. In your final CSV string from step 4, include only those rows where both names are unique and neither name repeats more than once in the entire list.",
